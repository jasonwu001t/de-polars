- **Refresh**: Scheduled daily updates with manual override

## 💡 Cost Optimization Strategy

### Traditional S3 Querying Costs

```
Monthly S3 Costs (Example):
• GET Requests: 1M requests × $0.0004 = $400
• Data Transfer: 100GB × $0.09 = $9,000
• Total Monthly: ~$9,400
```

### With Local Data Caching

```
One-time Setup:
• Initial Download: 100GB × $0.09 = $9 (one-time)
• Monthly S3 Costs: ~$9 (refresh only)
• Monthly Savings: $9,391 (99.9% reduction)
```

### ROI Calculation

- **Setup Cost**: Minimal (leverages existing infrastructure)
- **Monthly Savings**: $9,000+ (typical enterprise deployment)
- **Annual Savings**: $100,000+ (excluding optimization recommendations)
- **Payback Period**: < 1 month

## 🎯 Success Metrics

### Business KPIs

- **Cost Savings**: 10%+ of total AWS spend through recommendations
- **User Adoption**: 80%+ of finance/engineering teams
- **ROI**: 5x return on platform investment
- **Time to Insight**: <30 seconds for dashboard queries

### Technical KPIs

- **Availability**: 99.9% uptime
- **Performance**: 95th percentile <2 seconds
- **Data Freshness**: <4 hour staleness
- **Cache Efficiency**: >80% hit ratio
